*	The LinkRevSpec lookup algorithm may be wrong in case
	the number of branches is greater than one:
	The Go repository contains an example:

		R=$GOROOT
		hgo cat -R $R -r tip $R/doc/progs/eff_qr.go > /dev/null

	It must be adjusted so that it does not return the wrong
	filelog record.

*	store/casefolding.go does not properly encode paths ending in ".d"
	Example:
		hgo cat $GOROOT/misc/osx/etc/paths.d/go

*	Packages, esp. revlog, needs documentation.
