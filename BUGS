*	Meta headers. Apparently it can be the case that a
	branch starting record may contain an incremental update
	to only a part of a meta header. This requires reworking
	the meta header processing in revlog/filebuilder:
	Examples (files that don't have the meta header stripped):
		f=test/fixedbugs/bug136.go
		R=$GOROOT
		hgo cat -R $R -r a0f4eb9797d7 $f
		hgo revlog $R/.hg/store/data/$f.i

*	The LinkRevSpec lookup algorithm may be wrong in case
	the number of branches is greater than one:
	The Go repository contains an example:

		R=$GOROOT
		hgo cat -R $R -r tip $R/doc/progs/eff_qr.go > /dev/null

	It must be adjusted so that it does not return the wrong
	filelog record.

*	Packages, esp. revlog, needs documentation.
