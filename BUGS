*	In rare cases, a meta header can be part of
	non-base revisions too, like in case of plan9port's
	src/cmd/dd.c. Here, file revision 1 contains copyrev
	entries, but revision 0 is the base. The filebuilder
	must be adjusted to recognize this case.

	Example:
		hgo revlog $PLAN9/.hg/store/data/src/cmd/dd.c.i
		hgo cat -R $PLAN9 -r 2985 $PLAN9/src/cmd/dd.c | head


*	The LinkRevSpec lookup algorithm may be wrong in case
	the number of branches is greater than one:
	The Go repository contains an example:

		R=$GOROOT
		hgo cat -R $R -r tip $R/doc/progs/eff_qr.go > /dev/null

	It must be adjusted so that it does not return the wrong
	filelog record.

*	store/casefolding.go does not properly encode paths ending in ".d"
	Example:
		hgo cat $GOROOT/misc/osx/etc/paths.d/go

*	Packages, esp. revlog, needs documentation.
